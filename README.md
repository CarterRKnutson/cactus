## Running Cactus üèÉ

Getting started with Cactus is as simple as:

```python
from cactus.agent import Cactus

Model = Cactus(model_name="google/gemma7b", model_type="vllm")
Model.run("What is the molecular weight of the smiles: OCC1OC(O)C(C(C1O)O)O")
```

## Installation üíª

First, we must install the version of `pytorch` that is useable by your system. We can do this by following the `torch` install instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
Note that for some older versions of CUDA, you'll need to build from the compiled wheels [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/)

For example, using `pip` to install PyTorch 2.0.1 with CUDA 11.7 from the pre-compiled wheel:

```bash
pip install torch==2.0.1+cu117 torchvision==0.15.2+cu117 torchaudio==2.0.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```

Once you have the appropriate version of `torch`, we can continue with the install.

To install `cactus`, we can build from source:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.pnnl.gov/computational_data_science/cactus.git
cd cactus
python -m pip install -e .
```

## Benchmarking üìä

We provide scripts for generating lists of benchmarking questions to supply to the LLM agent.

These scripts are located in the `benchmark` directory.

To build the dataset used in the paper, we can run:

```bash
python benchmark_creation.py
```

This will generate a readable dataset named `QuestionsChem.csv` for use with the `Cactus` agent.
